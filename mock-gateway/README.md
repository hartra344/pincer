# Mock OpenClaw Gateway

Standalone Node.js mock WebSocket gateway for integration-testing an OpenClaw Gateway v4 operator client.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Defaults: `HOST=127.0.0.1`, `PORT=18789`, `MOCK_TOKEN=dev-token`, `MOCK_PAIRING=auto`.

Pairing modes:

- `auto`: first unknown device receives `PAIRING_REQUIRED`, then is approved after about 3 seconds.
- `off`: unknown devices are accepted.
- `manual`: approve by typing the printed `requestId` on stdin.

Run the full in-process self-test:

```bash
npm test --if-present
npm run selftest
```

Config and plugins (`config.mjs`):

- `config.get`, `config.schema`, `config.patch`, `config.set`, `config.apply` with redacted secrets, `baseHash` checks, validation issues, and `restart` for `gateway.*` changes. Writes need the `operator.admin` scope.
- `plugins.list`, `plugins.inspect`, `plugins.setEnabled`, `plugins.install`, `plugins.uninstall`, broadcasting `plugins.changed`.
- `weather` needs an `apiKey` (at least 8 characters); `browser` asks for capability consent before enabling; bundled plugins can't be removed.
- Install specs containing `missing` fail as not found; specs containing `unverified` require acknowledging the install policy warning.
